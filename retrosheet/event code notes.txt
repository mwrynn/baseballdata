event codes and how to handle:
# - a single digit indicates an out - for our purposes ignore the #'s value
## - same as above, I think typically 2-3 but there may not be a theoretical limit
##([# or B]) - treat same as above for our purposes
##([# or B])## - ground into double play
#(B)#(#) - lined into double play
C - catcher or pitcher/1st baseman interference - no at bat counted?
S# - single
D# - double
T# - triple
DGR - ground rule double
E# - error (no at-bat?)
FC# - fielder's choice (counts as hit)
FLE# - error on fly ball
H or HR - home run
H# or HR# - inside park home run
HP - hit by pitch
K - strikeout
K+[...] - strikeout plus event
NP - no play - a placeholder for when substitutions are made
I or IW - intentional walk
W - walk
W+[...] pr IW+[...] - walk/intentional walk plus event

there are more but these do not involve batter (e.g. BK is balk, CS# is caught stealing)

pa_is_hit:
true: S#, D#, T#, DGR, FC#, H, HR
false: anything starting with a #, C, E#, FLE#, starts with K, starts with I, starts with W, HP
null: everything else

stats we want per batter:
ALOH (At least one hit in game)	
PA (plate apperances)
HPA (hits per plate appearance)
