   NOPE: No rollup yet in postgres
   IDEA: How to fake rollup by year - can we use a windowing function? maybe something like sum(num_pa) over (partition by batter) ?
   NOPE: column "batter_game.num_pa" must appear in the GROUP BY clause or be used in an aggregate function
   NEXT IDEA: final query has to select it union the view but also figure out the overall aggregates disregarding year
     YES:  may work but ugly. so far got it working with total_pa_rollup

  let's get handedness of batter vs. pitcher 
  1. need to load roster data - done
  2. can join against roster to get pitcher's "throws" and batter's "bats" (handedness). a padj record means pitcher pitching with opposite hand but this only happened once in 1995 so ignore. However badj can happen when either A) a switch hitter ("B") does not bat the expected way (opposite pitcher's handedness) or B) non-switch hitter bats opposite his normal handedness (it happens enough)
